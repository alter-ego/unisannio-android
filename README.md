# University of Sannio Android App

Unisannio for Android uses:

* RxJava as Reactive Programming framework
* Jsoup and Gson for data retrieving and manipulation
* Dagger as dependency injection system
* ButterKnife as View Injector
* Lombok to save a bit of Java Boilerplate
* Android Styled Dialogs for a fancier UXD
* Advanced Android Logger as logging system
